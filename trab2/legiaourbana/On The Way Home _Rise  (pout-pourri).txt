When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane
Like a smoke ring day
When the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
Because you know me, and I miss you now
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had the
Chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
And I love you and I miss you now
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now? Oh, yeah
I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be white, I could be black
The time has come your second skin
The cost so high, the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
I could be wrong I could be right
I could be black I could be white
The time has come your second skin
The cost so high, the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
