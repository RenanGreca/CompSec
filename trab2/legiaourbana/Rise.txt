When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane,
Like a smoke ring day
When the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now.
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came,
And you had a
Chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now.
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now.
I could be wrong I could be right
I could be black I could be white
I could be right I could be wrong
I could be white I could be black
Your time has come your second skin
The cost so high the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written worksalie
May the road rise with you
Anger is an energy
