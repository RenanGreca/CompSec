I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of may
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
My girl
I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Well I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
My girl
I don't need no money
Fortune or fame
I've got all the riches baby
One man can claim
Well I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
My girl
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
My girl
I've even got the month of may with my girl
