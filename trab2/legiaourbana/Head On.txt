As soon as I get my head round you
I come around catching sparks off you
I get an eletric charge from you
That seconde hand living it just won't do
And the way I feel tonight
Well I could die and I wouldn't mind
And there's something going on inside
Makes you want to feel, makes you want to try
Makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky
I can't stand up, I cant' cool down
I can't get my head off the ground
As soon as I get my head round you
I come around catching sparks off you
And all I ever got from you
Was all ever took from you
And the world could die in pain
And I wouldn't feel no shame
And there's nothing holding me to blame
Makes you want to feel makes you want to try
Makes you want to blow the stars from sky
I'm taking myself to the dirty part of town
Where all my troubles can't be found, oooooh
Ah year, ah year
Makes you want to feel makes you want to try
Makes you want to feel makes you want to try
Ah year, ah year
