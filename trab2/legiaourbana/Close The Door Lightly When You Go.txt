Turn around, don't whisper out my name
For like a breeze, it'd stir a dying flame
I'll miss someone, if it eases you to know
So close the door lightly when you go
Who was the one that stole my mind?
Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one who made me feel unkind ?
So fare thee well, sweet love of mine
Take your tears to someone else's eyes
They're made of glass
And are cut like wounded lies
Memories are drifting like the snow
But close the door lightly when you go
Don't look back to where you once hade been
Look straight ahead
When you're walking through the rain
And find a light
If the path gets dark and cold
But close the door lightly when you go
But close the door lightly when you go
